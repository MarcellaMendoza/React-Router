export default App;



// Instructions

// In this lesson, you will modify the code in 'App.jsx' to show different elements at different routes using React Router. The Home component should show at the / route, the About component should show at the /about route, and the Contact component should show at the /contact route. Finally, the NotFound component should show at all other routes.

// Once you are done, try creating a new component and showing it at a route of your choice.
